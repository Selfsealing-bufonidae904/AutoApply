# AutoApply

**Automated job application platform that searches, scores, and applies to jobs on your behalf.**

AutoApply searches LinkedIn and Indeed, scores each job against your preferences, generates tailored resumes and cover letters using AI, and submits applications — all running locally on your machine. Your data never leaves your computer.

## Features

- **Multi-platform search** — LinkedIn and Indeed, with configurable job titles, locations, and keywords
- **Smart scoring** — Each job scored 0–100 based on title match, salary, location, experience level, and keyword relevance
- **AI-powered documents** — Generates tailored resumes (PDF) and cover letters per job using [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- **Automated applications** — Fills forms, uploads documents, and submits on LinkedIn Easy Apply, Indeed Quick Apply, Greenhouse, and Lever
- **Review mode** — Optionally review each application before it's submitted
- **Dashboard** — Real-time live feed, application history, analytics, CSV export
- **Desktop app** — Electron shell with system tray support (minimize to tray, runs in background)
- **Login session persistence** — Log in once, sessions are saved across restarts
- **Scheduling** — Set days and hours for the bot to run automatically
- **Fully local** — No cloud, no accounts, no telemetry. Everything at `~/.autoapply/`

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.11+ and Google Chrome installed.

```bash
# 1. Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/AbhishekMandapmalvi/AutoApply.git
cd AutoApply
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
python setup.py

# 2. Install Playwright browser (for job searching/applying)
playwright install chromium

# 3. Run
python run.py
```

The dashboard opens at `http://localhost:5000`. A setup wizard walks you through configuration on first launch.

### Desktop App (Electron)

For a native desktop experience with system tray support:

```bash
cd electron
npm install
npx electron .
```

1. **Search** — Playwright-based scrapers find jobs on enabled platforms
2. **Score** — Each job rated against your preferences (title, location, salary, keywords)
3. **Filter** — Jobs below your minimum score or on the blacklist are skipped
4. **Generate** — Claude Code creates a tailored resume and cover letter using your experience files
5. **Apply** — Bot fills out application forms, uploads documents, and submits
6. **Track** — Every application saved to SQLite with status, score, and generated documents

## Configuration

All settings are managed through the dashboard UI. Key options:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Job Titles** | Roles to search for (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Program Manager") |
| **Locations** | Where to search (e.g., "Remote", "New York, NY") |
| **Min Match Score** | Only apply to jobs scoring above this threshold (default: 75) |
| **Apply Mode** | `full_auto` (hands-free), `review` (approve each), or `watch` (observe only) |
| **Max Applications/Day** | Daily cap to avoid rate limiting (default: 50) |
| **Schedule** | Days and hours for automatic operation |
| **Company Blacklist** | Companies to always skip |
